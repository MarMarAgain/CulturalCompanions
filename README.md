# PP1 project - PCOS Cysters

## PCOS CYSTERS is a site aimed to be a first resource for those living with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.

This website serves as a user-friendly resource hub for individuals newly diagnosed or living with PCOS. The aim is to simplify complex information, ensuring easy comprehension for all users to assess their needs efficiently. Recognizing the variability of symptoms and experiences, I consolidated information from diverse sources into a single platform, providing clear insights into each resource's focus. My approach prioritizes accessibility, guiding visitors to accurate information in a friendly, casual tone, particularly beneficial amidst the often daunting medical literature surrounding PCOS.

## Features

* Navigation Bar
The Navigation bar is fully rsponsive and allows user to easily access all of the pages throughout the site.

* Landing Page-Hero Image
The tone of the image and title conveys the website. "Cysters" is a coloqial term by many in the PCOS community online and is easily identifyable. It's associated with comerardy, friendship and support. It encourporates a minor point of engagemnt through its scroll function.

The Links page is seperated into two parts. The first is links to other websites with a very short description on their individual focus. These links are action orientated ie. if the user wants to ask further questions, get an ebook, understand information about a certain aspect of PCOS ect. The sceond part is learning orientated. This is a list of podcasts twith short descriptions on their general focus. At the bottom, we have "watches of the week" two insightful videos that are easily accessible and cyster approved. All links are clickable and change apon hover/ clicking. All links open onto a new window for that link.
