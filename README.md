## PCOS CYSTERS is a site aimed to be a first resource for those living with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome.

This website serves as a user-friendly resource hub for individuals newly diagnosed or living with Poly Cystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). The aim is to simplify complex information, ensuring easy comprehension for all users to assess their needs efficiently. Recognizing the variability of symptoms and experiences, I consolidated information from diverse sources into a single platform, providing clear insights into each resource's focus. My approach prioritizes accessibility, guiding visitors to accurate information in a friendly, casual tone, which I hope to be particularly beneficial amidst the often daunting medical literature surrounding PCOS.

### Features

**Navigation Bar**
The Navigation bar is fully rsponsive and allows user to easily access all of the pages throughout the site.

**Landing Page-Hero Image**
The tone of the image and title conveys the website. "Cysters" is a coloqial term by many in the PCOS community online and is easily identifyable. It's associated with comerardy, friendship and support. It encourporates a minor point of engagemnt through its scroll function.

**Landing Page-Benefits Seection**
This is intended to give the user a quick insight into the scope of the website and what they can gain from it.

**Landing Page-Upcoming events**
This quickly shows the user what is currently on offer if they choose to engage. There is also an image of a mascot uterus to lighten the overall tone of the section.

**PCOS Page**
This page gives an overview of the condition. Its short and easy to understand with little distraction. It's seperated with  parallax sections for clear understanding and a smoother user journey. 

**Links Page**
The Links page is seperated into two parts. The first is links to other websites with a very short description on their individual focus. These links are action orientated -ie. if the user wants to ask further questions, get an ebook, understand information about a certain aspect of PCOS ect. The sceond part is learning orientated. This is a list of podcasts twith short descriptions on their general focus. At the bottom, we have "watches of the week" two insightful videos that are easily accessible and cyster approved. All links are clickable and change apon hover/ clicking. All links open onto a new window for that link.
